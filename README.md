# FFUF-Tips-And-Tricks

![maxresdefault](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66991901/106985150-167bd600-6793-11eb-95ab-dfb5774192f0.jpg)


### So what is ffuf?

Ffuf(fuzz faster u fool) is a great tool used for fuzzing. It has become really popular lately with bug bounty hunters/penetration tester. It is written in Go language.For this you can fuzz a large amount of words within a minute.

### Before using ffuf tool just see this image once

## wordlist:

Option name: -w

Use wordlist on ffuf for more affectively fuzzing. I use SecLists-master for example. You can choose yours. I have my own for dir brute forcing you can find it on https://github.com/tamimhasan404/wordlist.git

```
./ffuf -w /root/Desktop/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt -u https://xyz.com/FUZZ
```

/root/Desktop/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt this is just a path where is the wordlist is situated.

## Fuff with all domain

This is a common problem for beginners that they donâ€™t know how to use fuff in all of their collected subdomains as fuff has no default option for list of domains like dirsearch. So here is something for you which I found in https://twitter.com/0xJin tweet.

```
cat live.txt | xargs -I@ sh -c 'ffuf -w wordlists.txt -u @/FUZZ -mc 200'
```

## Filtering:


Option name: -fc

If you donâ€™t want to see any kind of specific status code then you can just filter them.

```
./ffuf -w /root/Desktop/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt -u https://xyz.com/FUZZ -fc 401,403,404
```
Comma-separated list of codes and ranges


## Recursion:

Option name: -recursion

With this option, it tries to find all possible dir accordingly your given wordlist. Let me explain if ffuf find /index.php dir then it fuzz it again with /index.php/wordlist. 
Suppose it finds/index.php/configtest.php then it fuzz it again like this /index.php/configtest.php/wordlist.

```
./ffuf -w /root/Desktop/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt -u https://xyz.com/FUZZ -recursion
```

## Recursion-Depth:

Option name: -recursion-depth

By default recursion depth level is 0.with this you set how many specific numbers of dir it find for you. Like 2,3 or 4 etc.

```
./ffuf -w /root/Desktop/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt -u https://xyz.com/FUZZ -recursion-depth 2
```
Here you see I set recursion-depth 2. Now ffuf find 2 dir basis of my wordlist if these dir are available on the targeted website then stop.


## Extention:

Option name: -e

```
./ffuf -w /root/Desktop/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt -u https://xyz.com/FUZZ -e .html,.php,.txt,.pdf
```
Sometimes it gives you valuable information. Which is maybe goldmine on your penetration testing/bug hunting.For this, you have to choose extension base on your target.


## Silent:

Option name: -s

If you just print the result and donâ€™t see any kind of fuzzing process on your terminal then use silent option.

```
./ffuf -w /root/Desktop/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt -u https://xyz.com/FUZZ -s
```

## Output:

Choose one -of json, ejson, html, md, csv

I generally use | tee for result output. But if you want to get output on GUI(graphical user interface) for your better understand/client demand then your CM is.

```
./ffuf -w /root/Desktop/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt -u https://xyz.com/FUZZ -of html -o ffuf-result
```

## Subdomain Enumeration

```
./ffuf -w /root/Desktop/wordlist.txt -u http://FUZZ.ab.com -of html -o result
```
Remember use http:// protocol after "-u" because sometimes many subdomains do not run over https.

## Throttle(Last one but an important one)

Option name: -rate 2 (set your number 2,3 etc)

This is very useful because with this you throttle/delay your request. As you know ffuf is very fast tool with that a large number of wordlist makes much noise on the server which may cause to block your IP,Dos,Slow down the server etc. To avoid this you can use -rate and your CM is.

```
./ffuf -w /root/Desktop/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt -u https://xyz.com/FUZZ -rate 2
```
rate 2 means two requests per second. You can also customize the number.

- Here are some other useful options on ffuf:

timeout â†’ HTTP request timeout in seconds (default: 10)

-V â†’ Show version information (default: false/off)

-t â†’ Number of concurrent threads(default: 40)

-v â†’ Verbose/details output,printing full URL and redirect location (if any) with the results (default:false/off)

-mc â†’ Match HTTP status codes, or "all" for everything (default: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403)

mode â†’ Multi-wordlist operation mode.Available modes: clusterbomb, pitchfork (default: clusterbomb(1 to 1,2 to 2)

Thank youðŸ’•
